Spaceflix is a space-themed, pixel-perfect clone of Netflix. Like the real thing, Spaceflix allows users to stream movies (trailers) on demand. Users can create and delete profiles, each of which has their own independent Watch List to save movies to watch in the future. Movies can be previewed by hovering over their thumbnails, and additional details can be accessed by opening their respective show-sections. In the future, Spaceflix will feature search functionality as well as recommendations based on movies a profile has already watched.

## Technologies

Spaceflix is built with <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> on the backend and <strong>React/Redux</strong> on the frontend. User and movie information is stored in a <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database and <strong>AWS S3 Storage Service</strong> is used for cloud storage of image and video files. The application is additionally supported by Webpack, Jbuilder, and Bcrypt.

## Technical Challenges
### Challenge 1

### Fading video controls based on user inactivity
The problem here is pretty straightforward - there is no event listener for the <em>absence</em> of user activity.
